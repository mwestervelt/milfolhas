In January 2001, to generate funds for the planting of trees for the Projeto Mil Folhas, Guga Casari and Chico Bicalho created ZéCar, an enthusiastic and fun collaboration, styled by the designer Guga Casari.

All Royalties, plus a generous Matching Fund from Kikkerland Design Inc. are converted entirely for the Mil Folhas Project. So far, ZéCar has helped to plant more than 100 thousand trees native of the Atlantic Forest, and will continue to help for the next several years, until all 300 thousand trees are planted, finalizing the project, so new reforestation projects can begin.
