Isolated from other major rainforest blocks in South America, the Atlantic Forest has an extremely diverse and unique mix of vegetation and forest types. It also embodies an enormous network of rivers, and vast amounts of fresh water. The Atlantic Forest has the largest variety of trees per square kilometer of all rainforests in the world, over 700 different species and sub species altogether; it houses over 20,000 plant species, 40 percent of which are endemic. Over 4,200 species of vertebrates, of which 6,300 reptiles have been, so far, catalogued, as well as 9,000 species of birds, and more than 4,000 mammals have been identified, and the number of different species of invertebrates surpasses 990,000.","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":1,"column":845,"offset":844}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":1,"column":845,"offset":844}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Today, patches of the original Atlantic Forest, or Mata Atlântica, are found along Brazil's Atlantic coast; from the northern state of Rio Grande do Norte, South to Rio Grande do Sul.

Today, with the increased expansion of urban areas in São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and Bahia, the Atlantic Forest is facing severe pressure from the issues tied to urbanization. But the Atlantic Forest also has a power of regeneration unequal to any rainforest, growing extremely fast and recomposing itself rapidly whenever left alone, free of human interference. The Mil Folhas Project, together with Kikkerland Design believe it is possible to accelerate this process, helping in the recuperation of the Atlantic Forest, and believe each one of us can contribute directly, or indirectly to help preserve, and save rainforests throughout the world.","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1,"offset":1995},"end":{"line":9,"column":798,"offset":2792}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1,"offset":1995},"end":{"line":9,"column":798,"offset":2792}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/Hotspots/"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/Hotspots/","position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1,"offset":2794},"end":{"line":11,"column":49,"offset":2842}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1,"offset":2794},"end":{"line":11,"column":49,"offset":2842}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1,"offset":2794},"end":{"line":11,"column":49,"offset":2842}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":14,"column":1,"offset":2846}}}}
